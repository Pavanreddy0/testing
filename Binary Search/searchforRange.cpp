/*
 Given a sorted array of integers A(0 based index) of size N, find the starting and ending position of a given integar B in array A.

 Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

 Return an array of size 2, such that first element = starting position of B in A and second element = ending position of B in A, if B is not found in A return [-1, -1].
